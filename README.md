# AJAX Demo Application

This is a simple demonstration application showing how to use AJAX to fetch data from an external API. The application fetches user data from JSONPlaceholder's user API endpoint and displays it in a clean, responsive interface.

## Features

- Demonstrates AJAX using both XMLHttpRequest (traditional) and Fetch API (modern)
- Shows loading indicators during data fetching
- Handles errors gracefully
- Responsive design that works on all device sizes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla, no frameworks)

## API Used

- JSONPlaceholder Users API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click the "Fetch Users" button to load user data from the API
3. Click the "Clear" button to remove the displayed users

## Educational Purpose

This demo is designed to help students understand:

- How AJAX works
- The difference between XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API
- How to handle asynchronous operations
- How to parse and display JSON data
- Basic error handling in AJAX requests

## Switching Between XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API

The demo uses XMLHttpRequest by default. To switch to the Fetch API implementation:

1. Open `script.js`
2. Find the line: `fetchButton.addEventListener('click', fetchUsers);`
3. Replace it with: `fetchButton.addEventListener('click', fetchUsersWithFetchAPI);`

This allows students to compare both approaches to making AJAX requests.
